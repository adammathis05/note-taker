# Note Taker

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- I wanted to take starter code and modify it to make a fully functional note-taker application. This was a good exercise to focus working on the back end and get practice working with routes and the Router. I'm feeling a little more comfortable using express but needed some assistance getting the routes to work. More practice will be needed here but I'm happy the application is working as intended.

## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:
